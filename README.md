# -Structured-Model-Pruning
This project prunes the convolution neural network through the scaling factor γ of the BN layer, which is a typical structured pruning work. It is my own reproduction and modification of the paper, the effect is very good.  （本项目通过BN层的缩放因子对神经网络进行剪枝，是自己对于Network Slimming论文的复现和修改，效果很好，是一个典型的结构化剪枝工作）
